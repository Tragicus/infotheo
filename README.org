This is a Coq formalization of information theory and linear
error-correcting codes.

** Requirements

The development version of the [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp][Mathematical Components library]]
(because we use the fieldext and finfield libraries).

Coq 8.8.2.
Compilation should be fine with previous versions except for 
minor problems due to recent changes in the Reals library.

** Installation

1. ~coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile~
2. ~make~
3. ~make install~
